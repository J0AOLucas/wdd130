      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>About Us Welcome to Idaho Bakery, a cozy and charming bakery located in the heart of Rexburg, Idaho. Founded in 2025 by João Lucas, a 25-year-old Brazilian with a passion for baking and bringing people together, our bakery is a place where culture, flavor, and community meet. João combined his love for traditional Brazilian recipes with the comforting classics of American baking to create a menu that’s both unique and heartwarming. At Idaho Bakery, everything is handmade with care — from cheesy pão de queijo and rich brigadeiros to fresh artisan breads, cakes, and cookies. We focus on high-quality ingredients, friendly service, and a warm atmosphere that makes every customer feel at home. More than just a place to grab a treat, Idaho Bakery is a celebration of diversity, friendship, and good food. Whether you’re craving something new or just need a familiar favorite, we invite you to stop by and taste the love we put into every bite.</p>
